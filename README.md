# Laravel SPA Boilerplate

My personal and opinionated boilerplate for building SPAs with Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind.

### Features

- Backend for creating, and authenticating users with JWT, and confirming their email.
- Backend support for password resets.
- Client-side code-splitted routes and views for login, registration, email confirmation, and password resets.
- Vuex store with user module.
- Tailwind for styling.

### TODO:

- [ ] More tests
